# Object vs Map:

>1. The construction is of course different

The object literal syntax is the simplest way to create an object map in JavaScript.
```
const gamesObj = {
  1: 'Citadels',
  2: 'Tzolkin'  
};
```
Maps are created using the built-in Map constructor.
```
const gamesMap = new Map([
  [1, 'Citadels'],
  [2, 'Tzolkin']
]);
```

>2. Keys on objects are strings, on maps keys are of any type

>3. Keys on objects are strings, on maps keys are of any type
Another difference is that objects created with the object literal have a set of unexpected key-value pairs from the Object.prototype.

When we print the Object.prototype you can see it has a few properties like ```hasOwnProperty, isPrototypeOf, toLocaleString, toString```.

An object created with the objectâ€™s literal syntax will have all these property keys on it. So the empty object {} is not really empty.

>4. Maps preserve the order of their keys, objects do not

The original order of key-value pairs is preserved in maps, while in objects it is not.
```
const gamesObj = {
  2: 'Tzolkin',
  1: 'Citadels',
};const keys = Object.keys(gamesObj);
console.log(keys);
//["1", "2"];
```
Notice that when the object is created the key 2 comes before the key 1. When retrieving all the keys 2 comes after 1.

Below is a similar collection built with the Map constructor. This time the initial order is preserved.
```
const gamesMap = new Map([
  [2, 'Tzolkin'],
  [1, 'Citadels']
])const keys = gamesMap.keys();
console.log(keys);
//MapIterator {2, 1}
```

>5. JSON offers support for objects but not for maps

# Arrow Functions vs Regular Functions

> An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a regular function expression, but is limited and can't be used in all situations.

Differences & Limitations:

    Does not have its own bindings to this or super, and should not be used as methods.
    Does not have arguments, or new.target keywords.
    Not suitable for call, apply and bind methods, which generally rely on establishing a scope.
    Can not be used as constructors.
    Can not use yield, within its body.

> Comparing regular functions to arrow functions
```
// Regular Function
function (a){
  return a + 100;
}

// Arrow Function Break Down

// 1. Remove the word "function" and place arrow between the argument and opening body bracket
(a) => {
  return a + 100;
}

// 2. Remove the body brackets and word "return" -- the return is implied.
(a) => a + 100;

// 3. Remove the argument parentheses
a => a + 100;
```
